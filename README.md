## Purpose
This application is a Weather Dashboard. The application uses an open weather API to fetch data, parse that data into JSON, and appened it to the dashboard. To start using the application, search for any city in the search bar. Upon submission of the search, a main card will appear with the weather data for that location for the current day (temp, humidity, wind speed, UV index, etc.). The submission will also return five more cards at the bottom, each representing the weather in that location for the next five days.
